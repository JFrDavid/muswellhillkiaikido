        <h2>About Aikido</h2>
        <p>Sensei Mark Greenley started practicing Ki Aikido in 1981 when he joined the Plymouth and Torquay clubs in Devon. Over the next few years he attended many training courses under the direction of Sensei Ken Williams, head of the Ki Federation of Great Britain at the Federations headquarters in Somerset.

            In 1984 Mark passed his 1st Dan Black belt grading and in December of that year he moved to London. He continued training at several North London clubs and travelled back to Somerset on a regular basses to attend training courses at headquarters.
